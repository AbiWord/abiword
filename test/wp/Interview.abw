<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: Eric, tell me a bit about yourself and how you were
involved with Mosaic development at Spyglass?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: I was with Spyglass early on, before it was an Internet
company. In the spring of 1994, I helped launch the Spyglass web
browser project, first as the primary engineer, and later as the
Project Lead. Anyway, Mosaic turned out to be a string of great
technical successes, interleaved with a string of great marketing
failures. Both were excellent learning experiences for me.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: So, tell me about your new company.</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: We got started in January of 1997 as a contracting firm, with
no specific plan for doing products. Contracting is lucrative, and
it's an easy business to run, but we started to realize that we wanted
to become a product company. We didn't find anything exciting enough
to bet the company on until the Open Source movement started to build
its momentum, earlier this year. In a matter of two months, we
constructed a plan for our Open Source products, hired five new
people, and changed our name to AbiSource.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: What got you interested in Open Source?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: I've been a fan of Open Source software for over a decade, but
I'll confess that prior to this past Spring, it had never occurred to
me that free software could become a mainstream phenomenon. The
Netscape release of the Mozilla code really drew my attention. I
started thinking about the possible business models which could be
built around the sale of services instead of around the sale of
software use licenses. Although I don't consider my views to be as
extreme as Richard Stallman's, I began to realize that the Open Source
philosophy of software has a tremendous future.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: But the concept of Open Source is not at all new. Why is the
future so bright now?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: It's important to recognize the role of the Internet as a key
distribution mechanism for Open Source software. Failure to figure
out a distribution scheme is a classic reason for software business
failure. Proprietary software models result in a house divided.
Vendors spend lots of time figuring out how to distribute their
software, while simultaneously spending lots of time figuring out how
to stop people from distributing their software. Open Source models
eliminate that inconsistency, allowing the vendor to focus more energy
on what is really important. The reason that the Open Source movement
can happen now is that the Internet is finally ubiquitous enough to
serve as a distribution medium to very large markets.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: What kind of Open Source products are you building?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: We're focused on desktop productivity tools, including word
processors, spreadsheets, end-user databases, and so on. Our first
product is a word processor, called AbiWord. The source code for an
early developer release of this app is being made available on August
21st. This launch is focused at software developers. When AbiWord is
ready for end-users, around the end of the year, we'll be making our
announcements to a much larger audience.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: Since you are producing "user" products, what if any is the
appeal of Open Source software to the end user? Do they care?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: They definitely care. Users are tired of the crazy upgrade
cycle which has become the norm for so many desktop applications. The
whole process is dysfunctional. The only reason we put up with it is
because we don't have alternatives. Why do we pay outrageous upgrade
fees every year or two, when the upgrades usually don't contain any
additional features we need? Because, all too often, we're actually
buying the upgrade to solve a *problem*, either an incompatibility or
a bug. Why do we put up with low quality software? Because features
sell upgrades, not bug fixes. The vendor has no financial incentive
to produce quality software, and the customer has no control. We all
know that the status quo is unhealthy, but we're not doing anything
about it.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Look at the top three office suites on the market. They're all
basically the same, right? Why then do we, as an industry, continue
to derive our revenues from intellectual property rights, when
proprietary technology is no longer the real differentiator? The big
vendors are charging for the wrong thing, and that's a sure sign that
they are charging way too much.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Strictly from a technology point of view, these kinds of applications
are boring, and they've been boring for years. It's time for them to
become commodities. Mainstream PC hardware already made this
transition, and now those vendors compete on price, and with
value-added services. Mainstream desktop software will go down the
very same road.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Do end users care about source code? Absolutely not. But Open Source
isn't just about source code. It's a better way to build software,
and it's a way to build better software. Users care a lot about those
things.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: What made you think there was an opportunity to do something
that traditional software product companies have given up on -- which
is to say -- challenge Microsoft on the Desktop.</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: We're challenging Microsoft? Really? When did they announce
a cross-platform, Open Source office suite? :-)</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Seriously, everybody asks me about Microsoft, because competing with
them is so fashionable right now. Frankly, I don't think of Microsoft
as our competition. We're not introducing yet another proprietary
word processor -- that would be suicidal. We're playing by different
rules. We admit that lots of people will continue to play by the old
rules, and Microsoft will continue to derive enormous revenues from
that market. In the early stages, we're making very conscious choices
to target our products at the niches of people who are not already
satisfied with the leading proprietary solutions from Microsoft and
others. That just seems like sensible marketing to us. To borrow
terminology from Geoffrey Moore, if Open Source is going to "cross the
chasm", we first have to target our products at the "pragmatists in
pain".</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: Next logical question is what makes you think that you can
form a company around "free software." You're not a team of
developers working for free on your spare time. You hope to make a go
of it as a company?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: Absolutely. We've done very extensive financial planning, and
our numbers add up. The potential user base for desktop productivity
tools is massive. We believe that millions of people will use our
products, and we can sustain a viable, growing company, even if only a
small percentage of our user base become paid subscribers to our
services.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: The key question is how will you fund the team to continue
developing the software that you are going to release?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Our company is in transition, and to some extent, the profitability of
our old business will help us fund our new one. However, the real
answer is that we're no different from any other software startup. We
need working capital to fund our operations until our new business is
profitable. We have some outside investors, and we're in the process
of looking for others.</P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in"><C PROPS="font-weight:bold">Dale: How will you know that your products are catching on? What
will be the signs of success that you are looking for?</C></P>

<P PROPS="margin-top:0.25in;margin-bottom:0.25in;text-indent:-0.25in;margin-left:0.25in">Eric: There are lots of signs that I'm looking forward to. I'm kind
of focused on AbiWord right now, since it will be our first product.
First of all, AbiWord will have reached a very small measure of
success when my Mom starts using it. I'll be very encouraged when I
see the first magazine review which we didn't know about in advance.
Later, I'm looking forward to the day I go to the bookstore and see 5
books about AbiWord on the shelf. Most of all, I can't wait for the
day that I'm making small talk with some stranger at a party, and they
don't know who I am, and they start telling me how great AbiWord is.
I think I'll probably just listen.</P>
