Build Instructions -- Linux, Solaris, ...
-----------------------------------------

The Linux tree should build easily assuming that you have all the tools
properly installed.  You'll need gcc, make, and all the tools which usually
accompany them.

You'll also need GTK version 1.1.15 or later.

Building the tree is a pretty simple process.  We use a "diving make" system,
where virtually every directory in the tree hierarchy has its own Makefile,
which contains the instructions for how to build the contents of that directory.

There are several ways to build and run AbiWord:

[1] Developer Style:  just cd into the abi directory and type 'make'
    and then 'make install'.  This will install the AbiSuite support
    files and create abiword and AbiWord symlinks in /usr/bin or
    /usr/local/bin to the executable.  This is a short-cut to creating
    a normal package and installing it.

[2] End-User Style:  just cd into the abi directory and type
    'make distribution ABI_BUILD_VERSION=x.y.z ABI_DIST_TARGET=<fmt>'
    where <fmt> is one or more of 'tgz', 'rpm', 'deb', 'slp', 'pkg'.
    This will create one or more archive files in abi/dist.  These
    may then be installed in the normal manner.


Build Instructions -- Windows NT
--------------------------------

Building on Windows NT is remarkably similar to building on Linux.  We
use the same set of Makefiles on Linux as well as NT.  You'll need to
get the CygWin32 tool set from Cygnus before you can build.  See
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/ for information and downloads.
The file you need should be called cdk.exe on B19 and full.exe on B20.1,
and it's going to be around 14 megabytes.  [This file is on the CD.]
Installing this stuff on your NT machine will create an environment
which looks remarkably like a UNIX box.  You'll get a standard bash
shell, GNU make, and all the standard UNIX utilities like sed, gawk,
cp, ls, mv, and so on.  This environment is the key which allows us
to use the same set of Makefiles for both NT and Linux.

Just in case you're wondering, yes, it should be possible to build
this tree with a subset of the tools.  There's 14 meg of stuff there,
and we don't *really* need all of it.  However, we haven't had time or
motivation to identify the specific set of apps we need.  Disk space
is cheap.  If you decide to make the effort to do so, please let us
know, and we'll share that information with other developers.

You also need Visual C++ 5.0.  Obviously, we don't use the IDE at all,
but we do use the compiler, headers, libraries, and so on.  You'll
need them all to be in your PATH, since the Makefiles will expect them
to be readily available.

Additionally, AbiWord uses the PNG and zlib libraries.  Both of these are 
available from our website [and included on the CD], and are peers of the
abi tree.  Once you have all this stuff downloaded, AbiWord should build
just fine.  The main AbiWord makefile will take care of building everything.

There are 2 ways to build and run AbiWord:

[1] Developer Style:  just cd to abi and type 'make'.  To run AbiWord, cd
    to the bin directory and type 'AbiWord -lib ../AbiSuite' -- this will
    help AbiWord find the dictionary and other support files.

[2] End-User Style:  just cd to abi and type 'make distribution ABI_BUILD_VERSION=x.y.z'
    This will build a setup program (abi/dist/setup.exe).  If you then run the
    setup program it will do a normal Win32 installation and create desktop
    icons and start menu items.


Build Instructions -- BeOS
--------------------------

Building on BeOS is similar to the other platforms.  We rely on the
GNU command line utilities for bash, sed, gawk, etc.  On Intel systems
we use GCC and on PPC we use MWCC.

There are 2 ways to build and run AbiWord:

[1] Developer Style:  just cd to abi and type 'make'.  To run AbiWord, cd
    to the bin directory and type 'AbiWord -lib ../AbiSuite' -- this will
    help AbiWord find the dictionary and other support files.

[2] End-User Style:  just cd to abi and type 'make distribution ABI_BUILD_VERSION=x.y.z'
    This will build a distribution zip file (abi/dist/AbiSuite-x.y.z-$(arch).zip).
    Expand this in /boot/apps.  You can then run /boot/apps/AbiSuite/bin/AbiWord.



=======================================================================================
FAQ
=======================================================================================

Where is the executable?
------------------------

The AbiWord executable is created in abi/src/$(OS)_$(OS_VERSION)_$(OS_ARCH)_OBJ/bin.
(on my machine this is abi/src/WIN32_4.0_i386_OBJ/bin/AbiWord.exe)  You may use this
copy to run for debugging or experimentation, but you should probably go ahead and
do an install.


Where are the other generated files?
------------------------------------

The object files (.o or .obj) are placed in abi/src/<platform>/obj
The library files (.a, .so, or .lib) are also placed in this directory.
