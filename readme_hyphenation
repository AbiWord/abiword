How to Support more languages

As mentioned before, we use Enchant to support more languages. So we have five backend to support more language. Take ISpell and mySpell for example.
In the folder ¡°abiword\msvc2008\Debug\¡± there are the folder for hyphenation: Spell and mySpell. And there is two folder for their dictionary. [[1]]

=================================3. Deploy of enchant in Abiword=================================
I just copy the buliding result of enchant to the right place in Abiword:
enchant\bin\Debug\libenchant_myspell.dll ---->abiword\msvc2008\Debug\lib\enchant\libenchant_myspell.dll
enchant\bin\Debug\libenchant_ispell.dll ---->abiword\msvc2008\Debug\lib\enchant\libenchant_ispell.dll
enchant\bin\Debug\libenchant.dll---->abiword\msvc2008\Debug\bin\ibenchant.dll

=================================4. How to support more languages in ISpell=================================
Go into the ISpell, you will see the folder language; you can just copy your languages¡¯ hyphenation dictionary into it. So that our abiword will support your language¡¯s hyphenation.
Now we support de, en, es, and fr.

=================================5. How to support more languages in mySepll=================================
The same as ISpell, to support more languages in mySpell, we can refer to the myspell folder.
