<td>

<P>The primary goal of the 0.7.0 release is to introduce the
availability of compiled binaries.  Accordingly, we're investing
effort in polishing the user experience.</p>

<P>We're also trying to be as sure as we can that the file format
implemented in this release is the not going to change again.  The
expectation is that with this release, people may start to <b>use</b>
AbiWord more, and we want to take steps to ensure document
compatibility.</p>

</td>

<td><P>We'll call AbiWord 0.9.0 when it has [substantially] all of the
features we want in our "1.0" release.  Accordingly, the list below
represents our current plan for the "1.0" feature set.  This
list is still subject to a certain amount of change.</P>

<P>After sufficient bug fixing on the 0.9.0 code base,
we'll call it 1.0.0 and consider it to be a maintenance tree.  When
we're ready to start adding post-1.0 features, we'll fork a new
development tree.</p></td>

<td><p>We're not quite sure where these features go yet.</p></td>

<td><p>We believe these features are NOT going to be in 1.0.</p></td>

<h3>Notes</h3>
</a>

<ul>
<li>This roadmap changes a lot.  More specifically, the status and
plan for the project changes a lot, and this roadmap struggles to keep
up.

<li>Version numbers use a scheme similar to the Linux kernel:
Major.Minor.Patch -- The Major version number indicates the overall
version of the app, with differences distinguishing very substantial
levels of features.  The Minor version number indicates an overall
level of features within that Major version.  Odd numbered Minor
versions are development releases which are not in maintenance.  A
release with an even numbered Minor version indicates a release which
is believed to be stable and which will be maintained even as
development of the next version proceeds in a separate source code
tree.

<li>There will not be a 0.6.0 release, as the features worked on
during the 0.5.x releases will not be placed in a maintenance tree.

<li>There will not be a 0.8.0 release, for the same reason.

<li>This is, in some sense, a To-Do list.  However, since it does not
include a complete listing of bugs, it should not be regarded as the
only listing of work that needs to be done.  The difference between a
bug and a missing feature can be subtle, at times.  We mention a
specific bug here under certain circumstances, such as when we know
that we'll want it to be fixed for a certain release.  In general, you
should check our <a href="http://www.abisource.com/bugzilla/">bug
database</a> for additional information.  The mention of specific bugs
in association with specific releases is not intended to imply that
those are the only bugs which will get fixed for that release.

<li>In general, this list contains only work which is not yet done.
Once it's done, we remove it from this list.  If it's partially done,
we'll remove it and replace it with a reminder of the part that's not
done yet.  If you want a summary of what has already been done, we'd
suggest our <a href="http://www.abisource.com/bonsai">Bonsai</a> 
or 
<a href="http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/">archives of the mailing list</a>.

<li>If you see an email address specified in parenthesis after any
item, that's the person we believe is working on it, or who has
mentioned an intent to do so.  If there's no email address there, we
probably don't know who's doing it.  Contributors welcome, AbiWord is
a 
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/index.html">Bazaar</a>.

<li>Please notify the mailing list if you see anything on this list
which is inaccurate or out-of-date.

<li>If you want to work on something, please mention your intent to do
so on the mailing list.  This will allow us to avoid clashes and keep
this roadmap up to date.  Also, most of the features mentioned below
have had at least some discussion, so there is a history of
assumptions about how each feature should work.  We don't have a full,
written spec for the behavior of everything, so if you want to uncover
those assumptions, you'll have to ask.  <tt>:-)</tt>
