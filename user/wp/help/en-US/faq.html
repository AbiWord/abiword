          <h3>Open Source Strategy Overview</h3>
          </a><a name="1.1">
          <p><b>What is Open Source software?</b><br>
          Open Source software differs from traditional proprietary software in
          that the <i>source code</i> (the underlying instructions which make
          the software function) is available as well as the application itself.
          For most users, the availability of source code is of no immediate
          benefit; however everyone benefits from higher quality software
          produced as a result of many individuals making improvements to the
          original software. For more information about the concept of Open
          Source, visit </a><a href="http://www.opensource.org">www.opensource.org</a><a name="1.2">
          <p><b>Why is it free?</b><br>
          We want everyone to use our product.
          <p>AbiSource is not shareware. You are not obligated, morally, legally
          or otherwise, to pay for using our products, ever. Please use our
          software, and please pass copies to everyone you know so that they can
          use it as well.
          <p>We have no hidden agenda.</a><a name="1.3">
          <p><b>What's the catch?</b><br>
          No catch. You don't have to make any compromises. Our products are
          always being improved. Initial releases may come out with only the
          essentials, but as Open Source software matures, it becomes as
          full-featured as the offerings from the leading proprietary vendors.
          Releasing our software as Open Source allows us to attain a higher
          level of quality than our closed source counterparts.</a><a name="1.4">
          <p><b>Will it work on my computer?</b><br>
          AbiWord works on several different kinds of computers. Versions are
          available for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Versions for
          Linux work with Intel, Alpha, and LinuxPPC architectures. There are
          also versions available for BeOS, Solaris and FreeBSD. Currently,
          AbiWord does not work on a Macintosh.</a><a name="1.5">
          <p><b>Is there support?</b><br>
          In the future, AbiSource will provide official technical support for
          all of our products. Currently, support is available by signing up for
          the AbiWord user mailing list. Send a message to </a><a href="mailto:abiword-user-request@abisource.com">abiword-user-request@abisource.com</a>
          with &quot;subscribe&quot; in the message body. To reduce spam traffic
          to this list, only its members can submit messages; you need to
          subscribe to it to send mail. We also host <a href="http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-user/99/">archives</a>
          of this list.
          <p>The AbiWord user mailing list is designed to facilitate discussion
          among users of AbiWord. The list is monitored by various AbiSource
          project members. You may use this list to:

          <h3>AbiWord Product Specifics.</h3>
          </a><a name="2.1">
          <p><b>What features are available in AbiWord?</b><br>
          Currently, there is quick list of features on the </a><a href="http://www.abisource.com/products.phtml">products
          page</a>. For an extensive look at AbiWord features, you can check out
          the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/feature_matrix.html">AbiWord
          feature matrix</a>. We also have a similar document cross-referenced
          by <a href="http://www.abisource.com/ui_matrix.html">operating system</a>
          Try AbiWord and see for yourself. It's a fast download, and the
          software is very easy to use.<a name="2.2">
          <p><b>Some menu items say to add code at a certain line. How do I do
          that?</b><br>
          This message is an indication that the dialog in question has not been
          added yet. As an Open Source project, everyone is encouraged to join
          in the development effort. This message is a reminder to those
          knowledgeable in programming languages such as C that their
          contributions are wanted. If you don't understand the specific
          instructions in this message, don't worry about it; be patient and
          these features will continue to appear with each successive release.</a><a name="2.3">
          <p><b>How do I change languages in AbiWord?</b><br>
          AbiWord can work with menus and strings translated into many different
          languages by changing an option. As there is no options dialog yet,
          changing languages requires hand-editing of the options file. For
          Linux and FreeBSD, this file is in your home directory in a hidden
          directory named .AbiSuite. For Windows, the file is usually in the
          Windows directory in a directory named AbiSuite. The file itself is
          named AbiWord.profile. Modify this file as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Find all occurences of the word <tt>_builtin_</tt> and change it
              to <tt>custom</tt>
            <li>Find three lines that typicall end with <tt>values=EnUS</tt>.
              These three lines begin with <tt>MenuLabelSet, StringSet, </tt>and
              <tt>ToolbarLabelSet</tt>. Change each of these three lines to a
              different value, such as <tt>FrFR</tt> for french.
            <li>Save the document, and relaunch AbiWord. All menus and strings
              should now be in your language of choice.</li>
          </ul>
          Currently supported languages are

          <p><b>I like using AbiWord in my native language. Why do I still see
          some English in the product?</b><br>
          Translations for AbiWord are provided by conscientious individuals all
          over the world who enjoy using AbiWord in their native language, just
          as you. As AbiWord continues to develop new features, occasionally
          there is a small time lag between when a new dialog or menu appears,
          and when all the new translated words can be submitted. You can help
          the translation effort by contacting the person responsible for your
          particular translation. To do so, look in your AbiWord directory for a
          folder named &quot;strings&quot;. Find the file associated with your
          language in that directory, and open it with an editor such as vi or
          notepad. At the top of that page, you will find the name and email of
          the person who is maintaining the translation.</a><a name="2.5">
          <p><b>If I type in another language, how do I have spell check work
          for that language?</b><br>
          Your AbiWord distribution contains a file called american.hash. This
          is a dictionary of English words. By replacing this dictionary with
          one from your language of choice, spell check will then mark only
          those words misspelled for the language you choose. A comprehensive
          list of available dictionaries is at </a><a href="http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell-dictionaries.html">http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell-dictionaries.html</a><a name="2.6">
          <p><b>When I try to install AbiWord on Windows, I get an error about
          missing COMCTL32.DLL.</b><br>
          COMCTL32.DLL is a Windows library AbiWord needs to run. Some older
          versions of Windows did not have this library. You can get it free
          from Microsoft at </a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp</a>.<a name="2.7">
          <p><b>How do I use True Type fonts for AbiWord on Linux?</b><br>
          Most GTK apps use X fonts exclusively, because what they demand of
          fonts is minimal. Most programs use fonts only for on-screen rendering.
          AbiWord also requires fonts to be able to sent to the printer. There
          are some complex issues regarding TrueType fonts in conjuction with
          printers on Linux.
          <p>The AbiSource solution is to keep a copy of scalable Type 1 fonts
          locally, Therefore, AbiWord can use only Type 1 fonts.</a>
          <p><b><a name="2.8">How do I enable vi and Emacs key bindings in
          AbiWord?</a></b><a name="2.8"><br>
          For the hardcore computer geeks out there, AbiWord is built with the
          ability to select arbitrary keybindings. You can switch between these
          different modes by pressing F12. The status bar will indicate the
          current keybinding mode is in use. Please note that not all vi or
          emacs keys are implemented, but most are. If there is a particular vi
          or emacs keybinding that you find is missing, remember that everyone
          is encouraged to join in the development process, and this might be a
          chance for you to make a contribution.</a></p>
