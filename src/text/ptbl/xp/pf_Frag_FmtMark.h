/*!
 pf_Frag_FmtMark represents a zero-length place-holder fragment
 in the document.  It is used to hold a formating information
 in anticipation of future text.  That is, we use it when
 the user does a 'toggle bold' or similar and before any text has
 been entered.  As soon as text is entered we will remove this
 marker (we may also remove it if the user moves the cursor
 away before actually entering any text).
