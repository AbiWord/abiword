In order to use AbiWord, you may have to add one or more lines to your
XF86Config file, usually located in /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/XF86Config.

For XFree86 >= 4, add the following line to the "Module" section:

	Load "type1"

For other X servers, please consult your documentation.

Also, if you are going to display AbiWord on a remote X server, besides
following the instructions above, please make sure that the files in the
${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts directory are available to the remote X
server and add the ${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts into server's font
path. For XFree86, add the following line to the "Files" section:

	FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts"

If you use a different X server, please see its documentation on how to
do this.

Finally, re-start your X server.
