#  Create the PSF file (input to swpackage):
#
cat << EOF > $TMPABIWORDPSF
#
#  Example hpux.abiword.psf PSF file, used to create an HP-UX depot file.
#  Dynamically created by $0, written by Kevin Vajk.
#  For more information, look for the manual "Managing HP-UX Software
#  With SD-UX" at http://docs.hp.com.
#
#  You must first compile and "make install" abiword on your build system.
#  If the systems you will be distributing this package to might not have
#  all the shared libraries you have (i.e. libpng), then you may want to
#  build static (UNIX_CAN_BUILD_DYNAMIC=0) or simply delete the shared
#  binary before making the package.
#
#  Important fields in this PSF file:
#    - The revision
#    - The os_release must not be *earlier* than this build machine.
#      (e.g. if you build on 11.00, os_release must not allow 10.20
#      machines to install the depot, but if you built on 10.20, it's
#      fine for 11.00 boxes to use.)
#    - The pathnames (/usr/local/AbiSuite, /usr/local/bin)
#  It also uses a configure script (see below), which it expects to
#  find in the current directory.
#
#  Now, here is how to build a depot from this PSF file:
#    # swpackage -x create_target_acls=false -x target_type=tape
#                -d hpux.abiword.depot -s hpux.abiword.psf
#  This creates a file hpux.abiword.depot, which you may distribute.
#
#  To install from this depot file, copy it onto your system, start up
#  "swinstall", choose "Local Directory" for the Source Depot Type, then
#  enter the full path to abiword.depot for the Source Depot Path.  Mark
#  the AbiSuite product, and install it.  Good luck!
