## This makefile serves two purposes.  It exposes an "install" 
## target, wherein it installs AbiSuite applications.  The
## eventual layout of these files is $(prefix)/AbiSuite, except
## for symbolic links in $(prefix/bin.  /usr/local is a good value
##  to use for $(prefix), and it is the default.
## 
## If you're looking to build distribution packages, this Makefile
## also provides the "distribution" target, which depends on 
## installation targets specific to the distribution layouts
## it will build.  These targets might be named "install_redhat"
## or "install_debian"; they place the program components into places
## their respective distributions would expect to find them.  These
## targets will be called by package tools like RPM.

# The plain "install" common to all Unix targets
