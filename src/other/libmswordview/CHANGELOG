Changes up to 0.5.2
	* implemented auto text color colour check for table cells, no more
	  black on black, or black on blue. i must look closely at what other
	  auto changes word makes.
	* some uber-simple greyscaling code when table look says no-color.
	* verified it works under AIX, made a few changes that showed up due
	to its stricter malloc, theres probably a few more malloc related
	issues hiding in there.
	* column breaks show up as well now.
	* the various types of section breaks are distinguisable from the
	others, and from page breaks.
	* a few changes to make sure formatting and tables get on better 
	together.
	* sequence field supported, i.e caption numbering, i just use the last
	fields that msword left in there.
	* changed hyperlinking so that it works with bookmarks that are in
	comments (annotations).
	* i now support multiple bookmarks that end on the same location.
	* multiple bookmarks that start on the same location should be supported,
	but no examples yet.
	* the comment author initials are extracted and used in the main document
	when referencing comments.
	* comments now end when they are supposed to, only the correct comments get
	included, should work for fastsave, not tested.
	* removed unused variables, sorted out a few other warnings, maybe itll
	squeak by the irix compiler now ?
	* names and initial info for comments is extracted as well, and stuck in a 
	table at the end of the document.
	* fixed the <a name= for comments, should work in fast saved.
	* custom graphics for annotations.
ALL TODO
	* whats the story with the page number ref that shows up in annotations ?
	* the bounds of the comment in the main document ?
	* strikethrough and annotations ?
	* start using the same structure names as word, and putting stuff like
	get_FIB in order, switch to using bit fields where word uses them
	rather than the current promotion to U8 that i do to keep my sanity.
	* allow the various colors that im using to specifiy different attributes to
	be modified by the user.
	* bookmarks embedded in html tags break them, constructs such as e.g
	<A href="stuff">stuf<a name="here">f</a></A> are being output even though
	thats well wrong in html.
	* optional html correct handling of lists.
	* hmm, with bookmarks implemented, it might not be too hard to do 
	the toc
	* place all wingding and symbolfont names directly in the makefile for
	make install.
	* convert the cross-referenced "above/below", into hyperlinked above and 
	below.
	* support ole embedded graphics ?
	* optional support for specifying special fonts, not recommended for use
	on publishing for internet sites, but useful for internal use for those 
	of you who have done the funky chicken dance with unix netscape to work 
	with ms winding etc fonts or are using ie/netscape on windows.
	* all the fields, document background colour, wmf converter .
	* it might be possible to support right indentation, if its simultaneous
	with equal left indentation by using <blockquote> instead of <dir>, but
	i dont see that as essential.
	* inside/outside page numbering doesnt work, dont know where its set.
	* find the location of whatever sets the footnote & endnote styles of 
	numbering, as its currently unknown, i havent figured it out yet, this
	isnt super essential though, but it is annoying.
	* all endnotes are listed at the end of the section rather than optionally
	at the end of the document, i dont know how this is done, doesnt appear 
	documented.
	* two pass parser for finding best fit html tables for word tables.
	* you know i could really do with a nifty logo.
	* gtk+dps wysiwyg viewer, output to ps from this
	* --> xml support ??, im told that xml is the way to go, i dont know a thing
	about it yet, so the next task is to learn it.
	* use incremental zlib functions to do decompressing rather than use mmap.
	* make sure annotations references always get shown in the normal font ?
	* hyperlink sequence fields ?
	* doesnt compile under neXt ?
	* do a check for mman.h and dont do compression if not there.
Changes up to 0.5.1
	* forgot to change the version no in the source.
	* damn sunsite broke connection half way through uploading.
Changes up to 0.5.0
	* Martin Kalms <kalms@lysator.liu.se>, configure fix for sunos 4.1 in
	relation to strerror.
	* added option where you can ignore table widths.
	* custom graphics for comments.
	* endnote autonumbering now works, now defaults in roman numerals.
	* fast save footnote problem fixed, though i think things might be
	even more complex that i thought, so keep an eye on that area.
	* footnotes are in a colour of their own.
	* symbols as footnotes, required a change to the 4a30 sprm that might fix
	a few other char formatting issues.
	* restarting footnotes on each page, and each section works, this is 
	encoded in the the number itself it appears, a href and a name, and some 
	invalid html code fixed in the footnote area as well, footnotes are now in 
	a colour of their own *but* the location of whatever sets the footnote & 
	endnote styles of numbering is unknown, i havent figured it out.
	* all endnotes are listed at the end of the section rather than optionally
	at the end of the document, i dont know how this is done, doesnt appear 
	documented.
	* textmarks / bookmarks and explicit hyperlinking supported, bugs in 
	old code removed hopefully and internal hyperlinks put in via insert
	hyperlink are supported.
	* support for bookmarks, i.e they are converted to <a name>[text]</a> html 
	code.
	* converted cross-referenced textmarks/bookmarks into hyperlinks.
	* wmf files can now be decompressed thanks to peter.brandstrom@ericsson.com
	now i need a wmf --> something useful converter. i see that theres a new
	one available off the gimp plugin page, with some uberhacking it might
	do the trick, the notes/wmf dir has a goodly chunk of info on the format if
	anyone wants to do it for me.
	* when bookmarks are embedded in bookmarks something odd appears to occur, 
	but nonetheless the ms save as html does the same, so im assuming that its 
	ok
	* added bookmark support to fastsaved, should work fine, not tested.
	* pagebreak gifs are correctly centered if the next para is a centered etc 
	one.
	* author field supported.
	* proper positioning of page numbers, general layout of headers appears
	to be fine, except that tab stops are used in headers to center, left
	and right align headers, which doesnt work so well in html mode.
	* added defensive code to some sort of list bug.
	* mimic strike-through and double st by setting the text color to either
	#ed32ff or #ff7332
	* disallow height commands inside tables, as the model of paragraph heights
	doesnt fit well with the architecture for tables, so im ignoring them in
	tables, hopefully noone will notice :-)
	* fixed a small bug in sprm which was causing errors later in lists.
	* tables and paragraph formatting were misaligned across td boundries.
	so now i clear specials and fonts on entry to a table, and on exit of each
	cell, hopefully i broke nothing else on doing so.
	* at least one really bad conversion with a file called RESUME.doc, but in
	my defence i looked at the msword conversion of this to html, and its just
	as buggered up so rasp ;-P
	* added credits file
	* found problem in decompress code, i didnt make it good enough for real
	world usage, i now use mmapping so make my life easier, dont know if this
	is fully portable, works on linux and solaris.
	* oledecod had bugs on cleanup, so sent filters group wmf.doc and 
	Contribu.doc to demo the problems.
	* i now use oledecod 0.0.4 which fixes cleanup problems, but Contribu.doc
	style problems continue, they return 5 but laola can extract the streams
	nonetheless while oledecode cannot, i modified the original laolareplace.c
	to handle this as well.
	* oledecod 0.0.4 has a bug in relation to 1812bb.doc, laolareplace.old.c
	hasnt this bug, so im back to using that again.
	* those ffffffff's in lists that haunted me in earlier releases are *back*
	grrrrr!!, anyway ive another massive nasty workaround that im using that
	hasnt crashed any docs, and appears to do the right thing, at least in
	propos~s.doc
	* wmf decompression code changed to use mmap, replaces the original code
	that ate memory, if mmapping doesnt work try looking at the zlib docs
	and change the code to fixed buffer incremental decompression.
	* added a bailout to ignore encrypted documents, wonder how id decrypt
	them if i had the correct password, anyone know ?
	* added a bug fix for crossreference parsing.
	* beginnings of tables of contents included, doesnt always work yet.
	* bug where if the word file ends on a table, the table wasnt closed off is
	fixed.
	* bug where non built in graphic types were causing hangs.
	* im now often happily (if slowly) converting 90 and 100 page documents,
	the only thing i really am unhappy with is table handling, which is
	also one of the reasons the conversion is *soooo* slow sometimes, the
	other reason is those godforsaken fastsaved files.
	* fixed some other mem related bugs, converted sucessfully the last two 
	problem docs without crashes.
	* table looks are somewhat supported, though theres no support for last
	row and last column different from the rest of the cells as of yet, this
	will have to wait until multi pass on tables is implemented.
	* the foregrounds and character attributes in general for tables appear
	to always set correctly in general, but i believe i have to look into
	how the "auto" text color selects is final colour, as ive been assuming
	that it gets set to black, which is a fairly valid assumption most
	of the time, but not always, so a few docs will have black text on
	black backgrounds in table cells, but the situation is much improved.
	* ran purify over mswordview, removed a load of dodgy code out of it, theres
	still a bug or two hiding in the list code, which i belive is the reason
	that lists are sometimes missing in complex documents, e.g meeting.doc
	i think i love purify, its the bees knees.
	* dib's are now extracted as well, though i dont do anything with them yet,
	this fixes yet more crashes.
	* fixed laolareplace.old.c, which is the version im going to use for this
	release, to work on 64bit platforms, a few longs had crept into the code
	there which shagged the whole thing up. I havent done extensive tests on
	64bit yet, but im confident that itll work.
	* fixed defines to make it work if theres no zlib present.
	* no crashes after running mswordview on 300 megs of uploaded files.
	* good enough to upload to sunsite, version number reflects this.
changes up to 0.4.9
	--This is an interim release while im in scotland until later this november--
	added features are that the gateway is included, endnotes are supported,
	pagebreaks that split tables are supported and some more bugs are fixed,
	especially in relation to graphics.
	* added -o - option to gateway, like i should have about 4 releases
	ago.
	* fixed graphics again, forgot to reset the extra amount that some have
	before the graphic data begins, means more jpgs and pngs should work.
	* endnote text done in simple saved
	* cleaned up beginning whitespace from footnotes/endnotes/comments.
	* endnotes in complex mode is in, needs testing.
	* changed url code to match the other field code, fixes a big bug there.
	* header and footer colours were wrong again, fixed.
	* indent drift is fixed again, moved do_indent into decode_?_specials
	* pagebreaks can occur in the middle of a table, this sort of confusion
	is fixed for full saved files, and is probably fixed for fastsaved files
	* pagebreaks now look like they occur after footers,footnotes and endnotes.
	* custom graphics replace <hr>'s as there were too many of them at the
	bottom of a page to figure out what was what.
	* custom graphics for footnotes, and comments
changes up to 0.4.8
	* this has a slew of bug fixes related to graphics and a new option
	to put images in a certain directory
	* fixed f006 code in blip handling, removing a slew of hangs.
	* ignore every graphic that isnt an understood type, removes hangs.
	* figured out when theres an extra 16 bytes to delete from the beginning
	of a blit, and where one of my magical 17s were coming from
	* got a bug fix off Harry Shamansky (shamansky@adinc.com) as to why
	the default make wouldnt work under irix.
	* the current spid handling was mismatching spids and the graphics
	involved.
	* i cant handle forms, or ole data, so ive added a check to avoid
	doing them, removes crashes.
	* also ive added some other code to watch out for unsupported graphic
	features.
	* msword can include wmf and emf files, these are stored in compressed
	form, using lz encoding in a fashion supposedly compatable with the zlib 
	library, but i havent been able to decompress them yet and even if i 
	could i dont know of any source to convert wmf/emf files to anything 
	usable under linux
	* ive changed blip handling, so that it works better, well i believe its
	more crash resitant, but im still not 100% happy with 0x01 handling.
	* if you insert a bmp via insert->picture->from file, it appears to
	be converted to png for you, handy.
	* paragraph indentation is back in, lists and table were confusing the
	indentation code.
	* fixed titchy bug so that space at beginning of lists isnt underlined.
	* support paragraphs whose first lines indentation is greater that the rest
	of it
	* support vertical space between paragraphs.
	* sorted out end_para for the first paragraph found in complex mode, i think
	i have it right now, in passing i reckon a load of those pap searches
	in complex mode are unneeded, but i dont want to rock a working boat, if it
	aint broke dont fix it as an uncle of mine used say, though we did seem to
	spend an awful amount of time panically fixing things that broke 
	dramaticlly after years of neglect.
	* finally settled on dirs for left indentation, blockquotes indent from both 
	sides automatically
	* added an option to put graphics in a specified dir.
	* added an option to find the graphics at a specified url.
	* updated man page.
	* made another change to blip handling, fixes some problems.
changes up to 0.4.7
	* warning !, in this release mswordview no longer outputs by default to
	the screen. use -o - for this behaviour. This is an interim release to
	reassure people that im still working on it, its got quite a few new
	features and bug fixes since 0.4.4 read down for them all.
	* implemented tabbing with trans gif, optionally use hardspaces or 
	dont do it at all.
	* added some support for borders such that the vertical space between 
	paragraphs due to width of borders is retained through the use of 
	vertical trans gif space.
changes up to 0.4.6
	* indentation of paragraphs dithered to <blockquote>'s is out again as it 
	its doing strange things on long complicated documents.
	* table cell shading done, fully supported i believe.
	* drew all the available table patterns in all available colors, 
	made small transparent gifs out of them, if someone wants to do 
	better copies of the ms ones go ahead, use the convert.sh script
	in the patterns dir to generate pics in all necessary colors.
	* text color support is in
	* word underline, which iswhere whitespace isnt underlined is supported.
	* courier as an alternative to courier new, times alternative to
	times new roman font face, helvetica as an alternative for everything 
	else.
	* all caps supported, Small caps supported, though i want full tests
	of those two babies in all modes. Similiar to the fontfaces these two 
	babies are only supported in ascii languages, as i dont really know how 
	to convert utf-8 unicode into upper case !
	* text animations supported by converting them to blink :-)
	features-examples dir added, supported-font-features.doc has what i
	believe is all the font features that word supports demonstrated in it.
	id be happy to have omissions noted, mswordview now supports
	1) font size
	2) colored text, (in headers and footers as well)
	3) font face in ascii based languages
	4) underline, including word underline, where whitespace is nt underlined
	5) super and sub script
	6) All caps and small caps (ascii based languages only)
	7) text animations dithered to blink tag
	mswordview doesnt support due to html limitations (at least i dont think
	i can do them)
	strikethrough,double strikethrough,shadowed and outlined text, embossed
	or engraved text. 
	"hidden text" is shown, coz i dont know the purpose of it yet
	all caps, small caps and font face for non ascii languages.
	character spacing
	* centralized pap initialization code
	* fixed a crash causing blip bug
	* fixed a crash due to sep sprms showing up in a papx !!, i ignored them
	im sure that will bite me hard in the future, but ive documented it here so
	i wont forget.
	- Problem:
		now we have a problem with paragraph properties which is only making
	a difference now that i want to use the paragraph justification codes.
	there exist pieces which have fc's greater than the maximum one listed
	in the plcfbtePapx !, ive been pushing them around for the last 2 days to
	no avail, im beginning to think that maybe this means that they have no
	native formatting of their own, the catch is to find the paragaph that they
	belong to, the spec says to find that by taking the smallest fc in fkp
	tables that is bigger than the current fc, but there *is none* thats bigger.
	my thought is to remember if this piece is the beginning of a paragraph
	mark and if not inherit the previous piece's formatting, and keep going
	backward until we get one. If it is then either im supposed to default to
	a new one or go forward to find one.
	+  Solution: Ah-ha i believe i have it, 
		+ firstly varient 1 gpprls have to be supported, and i had some offsetting 
		in them wrong
		+ secondly i had a very subtle bug where i changed the value of the avalrgfc,
		from when i didnt know why sometimes they were +400000000, of course i now
		use it to determine if the end of the piece if twice the distance of its 
		reported character len of not, and with the val reset i ocassionally had
		the piece recorded as being too long, so the paragraph properties of the 
		wrong paragraph were being used.
	* added is paragraph formatting information, supported well is
		1) centering,		center
		2) right justification , div align=right
	* made a closing paragraph thing like the closing chp for the blurb at the
	bottom to avoid having the version info centered of justified.
	* 0x01 fSpec graphics are now supported in addition to 0x08 graphics 
	  while both of these are draw objects, only non-vector graphics are supported, and 
	  only partial support of those i.e png and jpg.
	  as with the 0x08 graphics theres a lot of magic emperically derived offsets being used
	  to put it together, so dont be too surprised at getting corrupt images.
	  though i *have* fixed a bug in png handling i believe for 0x08 graphic which was the
	  previous subset i supported.
changes up to 0.4.5
	* i now open graphic and doc files in binary mode to support platforms where this
	makes a difference.
	* replaced laola, perl no longer required, thanks to the mighty
	Andrew Scriven who replaced the OLE functionality i needed with C
	* got a bug fix off above to handle files with more blocks
	* optional support for fontface if the text if an ascii based one,
	i.e if were guaranteed that this is a western european language
	then we do font faces, fastsaves will probably confuse this test and
	mean we wont get faces even when we can handle them correctly.
	* changed indent method for outline lists to multiple hard spaces, rather
	than <dir>'s, in the future ill make an optional proper html conversion,
	but it wont look like the original, so its a TO-DO.
	* indentation of paragraphs dithered to <blockquote>'s is in, alpha support.
	* absolute width and height of tables is in as well.
	* i now default to outputting to a file whose name is the same as the input
	file, with .html appended. graphics are output to the files with the same 
	prefix as the .html file. use -o - to output to stdio
	* new ole code was broken on a few files ( 1 :-) ), fixed this. 
changes up to 0.4.4
	* a good few bug reports in, crashes and what not, i got the use
	of purify on a sun box (thanks to martin mellody et al) and sorted
	out *all* the uninitilized mem reads there, (3000 of them in the course
	of a typical conversion!!), it still leaks memory like a sieve but thats
	not important for mswordview, though i will sort that out. purify is
	a wonderful piece of work i have to say.
	* changed ffffffff handling for lists, i think it means that
	the list in question isnt actually there, so to skip it.
	* changed blockquotes to dir, looks neater and word itself does
	it, biggest software company in the world cant be wrong, can it ?
	:-)
changes up to 0.4.3
	* oops, i shafted the inclusion of getopt for systems that need it.
changes up to 0.4.2
	* fixed broken simple mode footnotes (doh!)
	* fixed bug in blip where having drawings where none
	of them was a picture caused a crash
changes up to 0.4.1
	* did some tweaking to remove a crash.
changes up to 0.4.0
	* and big breaking news, preliminary graphic support is now in!!
	yes, gifs/pngs/jpgs added to a document through the 
	insert->picture->from file mechanism now convert correctly. They
	are stored in the office draw format which ive just cracked the 
	rough layout of. (through the handy ms spec on the msdn site),
	graphic support is messy for now, as the files are generated in
	the cwd of mswordview and named graphic*mswv.*, ill tidy it up
	later, this news is too good to not get an announcement.
changes up to 0.3.0
	* added -m  --mainonly option if you dont want headers and footers.
	* added a few more places to look for lls-mswordview
	search order is now
	1 in the path.
	2 the same dir as lls was run from if ran absolutely.
	3 the current dir.
	4 a dir called laola off the absolute path.
	5 a dir called laola off the current dir.
	but stuff line ../../mswordview isnt in there though, coz folk should
	just put lls-mswordview into their path dammit!
	* diffent numbering formats for pagenumbering is in, a vs i vs 1 etc.
	* gpprls for sep's work now, complex sections are in.
	* found some strange code in clx_headers and clx_footers so i blew it 
	away.
	* section support in for simple saved files.
	* sections that restart pagenumbering work now.
	* sections that have no footers/headers at the beginning work now.
	* complex support for sections is in as well, should work hopefully
	needs extensive testing.
	* TO-DO text color, eventually font faces, but no sleep lost on that i have
	to say.
	* TO-DO shaded cells in a table, think up a better table handling method.
	* i now stick a space into an empty cell so that it shows up.
	* another U8 wraparound bug removed.
	* i now use the piecetable for simple docs, so as to skip over sections
	that arent to be processed, i.e the simple format is just as complex as
	the complex format :-), i think ive done this right and it wont break 
	anything, ill have to wait and see though.
	* changed slightly the portions of a field that dont get printed,
	to make some html ones work, hope i havent shafted anything else.
	* hmm, really need to cleanup character handling, unicode &
	special reserved ms symbols and so on, im just plinking at
	them for the moment.
	* aghh, found another U8 overflow, what possessed me to put
	them in in the first place ?, i should have guessed that
	there would be hundreds of pieces in a file.
	* received report that it compiles and runs with
	Sparc solaris 2.5.1 - sparcworks compiler
	&
	Intel x86 solaris 2.5.1 - gcc compiler
	* added patch from diakka <diakka@staff.sinanet.com> to run
	create_bins on a make rather than make install
changes up to 0.2.2
	* compiled it on a solaris account i got, and its fine, got 
	confirmation that it works from Will Renkel <renkel@cig.mot.com>
	* changed fastsaved chpnextfc check to be >= rather that >, hope that i 
	dont break anything cox of it.
	* foolish error, U8 used for number of pieces, extended to U16
	* changed embedded link handling to not end character properties in
	the middle of a URL !
	* changed embedded link handling so as to *not* place "" around urls,
	as sometimes they are there already, and not having them doesnt hurt,
	though it offends my sense as to how they should be done.
	* would you *believe* these ms guys, now they are hitting me with
	file offsets that are past the end of the file !!, so now i have to
	watch out for that, the complex format is *such* a collection of
	hacks, ah-ha ive just checked in word, this file crashes word :-)
	so this is the first reported case of mswordview being better than 
	msword, though i have to say that in recovery mode word pulled loads
	of text out of it that i didnt get, :-(, still its a corrupt file
	so doing anything at all is a success.
	* i forgot to reset the higher list levels when changing a lower one,
	fixed now, i think ive it right.
	* added a define of SA_RESTART to 0 if it isnt there. bash does it so
	i should get away with it, sunos seems to need it.
	* added a little patch from Zachariah Baum <zack@studioarchetype.com>,
	that should help get around folk who run mswordview absolutely and dont 
	stick lls-mswordview in their path, ie make and then dont make install.
	* fixed yet more bugs, for some reason i thought that
	the order of evaluation was from right to left !!!!
	i.e i was doing 
		if ((*p == 'a') && (p!=NULL))
	doh!
	* changed web interface so that utf-8 is always on.
	* font characteristics turn off when going into tables now.
	and turn back on when inside, gets rid of some off look
	and feel.
	* checked out corel's wordperfect import functionality with
	office 97 files, conversion isnt as good as mswordview i think.
	missing header numbers, and one or two didnt convert at all.
	though of course corel retains layout which mswordview cant
	do with html, and does shading, ill check pictures at some stage.
	* have a report that suns pcfileviewer similarly covers about 50%
	of mswordview's functionality and vice versa.
	* gzipped uploaded word file collection has just hit 120megs :-)
	* i now look at this section table so i know whether its a section
	break or page break. If its a section break, then the header/footers
	revert to the beginning again.
	TO-DO, add an space to empty cells to make them look reasonable in 
	netscape.
	TO-DO check page numbering with sections.
	TO-DO, do endnotes, should be easy. make new pic to replace hr
	lines, theres too many hrs now at the bottom of a page to make
	sense to anyone anymore. if theres no footers, then dont do
	the lines.
	TO-DO, continue with the sent files since 0.1.0, and the rest
	of them.
changes up to 0.2.1
	* removed bug that caused lists to drift further and further
	right.
	1. checked out the blockquote indention for lists, doesnt
	appear to be right for srom*.doc, fixed now
	took closer look at font scanning in decode_letter,
	in particular special chars, the < 39 wasnt precise enough, being
	in a wingding/symbol font seems to make you automatically a special
	char.
	2. something not fully right with lists that take their
	text as special chars (i.e sectionnumber), not done by ms in
	an obvious fashion. edit doc down to just the 2 headers and then
	see what happens.
	3 AHA!!!, 1 and 2 are wrong, as was previous ideas to ignore lists
	that appear to have nothing in them, they are there to artifically
	bump lists up to a different starting number without requiring a
	seperate list definition for each one, ms shoves in dummy elements
	to get the list up to the right number, the section id just before
	one of them threw me entirely, i thought the section number should
	have been the text of the list. ive got it now!
	* 3 above is *rubbish*, thats not it at all, i was right originally,
	ignore those 0 len lists, and the problem was with my list restarting
	mechanism which didnt work if there was more that 1 list between list
	section that had to continue numbering.
	* numerical outline list sublevels will retain the prefix of the 
	above levels, this required a change of the number figuring out code,
	its now rather heavy of silliness, but it works, i dont love it and
	im sure lists will be back to get me again at some stage, but outline
	lists now work, in particular the 
	1
	1.1
	1.1.1
	style.
	* TO-DO sections, srom*.doc has them, check them out.
	* TO-DO change web interface so that the utf-8 can kick in if 
	needs be.
	* fixed bug where the new piecetable check in simple saved
	files fell apart after hitting a footer.
	(tempcp = tempcp, rather than realcp=tempcp, doh!)
changes up to 0.2.0
	* well arse again, ive revised my ideas as to what consititutes
	the end of a piece, rather than the beginning the the next piece as
	i was doing, i now believe thats its the beginning of the piece +
	the twiddled cp len. makes more sense, and removes crashes from the
	latest doc i was given.
	* distinguishs between odd & even page footers.
	* TO-DO odd & even headers
	* added the tm symbol as a special case, theres quite a large
	range of unicode that ms is using that is part of the customizable
	section, i.e theres loads of glyphs that ms can use that are not
	part of the standard unicode set, the tm appears to be one of hundreds.
	eventuallly ill have to get a table of them.
	* woweee, is ms an evil designer of data formats, they have two
	types of simple saved docs i thought, those in 8 bit (basically ascii) 
	and those in 16bit (unicode), hah bloody hah, ive been given one which is a 
	mixture of both, and i have to use the damn piecetable to shove it together.
	and its not as if the document shifted into a different language of 
	anything. if this was fastsaved id not blink an eye, but simple saved, 
	come *on*, why bother calling it simple saved. so i have to keep an eye 
	on the piecetable to determine what exact offset to use after all.
	* added a huge bit filthy hack in for more list twiddlings, the 
	previously mentioned unknown 4 byte sequence now rears its head
	as an optional 8 byte sequence !!, but always ffffffff, it might
	be some kind of flag or summat. anyhow i now chew up any 4 bytes
	consisting of this if they show up in the place that they might
	appear, this removes a large crash that occurs otherewise, as all
	the counters get thrown off course by them.
changes up to 0.1.1
	* added Makefile patch from Pavel.Roskin@ecsoft.co.uk (says it works
	on hpux)
	* well the good news is that the unicode utf-8 is working for
	taiwanese and im sure other languages, the bad news is that everyones
	telling me that noone in their language group is actually using unicode :-)
	so i suppose i require a huge unicode --> JIS/EUC/KSC/Big5/GB converter.
	:-)
	* rudimentary support for annotations, i havent too many examples of these 
	  but i think they'll work fairly well.
	* rudimentary support for all special ascii codes for time,page no etc.
	p.s by rudimentary support i mean that if asked for e.g the current date
	in a particular format i output the date, maybe in the correct format
	maybe not. i.e the meaning is the same, though the look might be different.
	* added a supported sprm, that changes chp information totally to the
	chp of a different style.
	* added support for custom footnotes, had to do a bit of a hack to
	get the <a name> stuff right, hopefully it'll always work, even if it
	doesn't itll still be readable.
	* twiddled the char formatting dependancies about again, really ill have
	to redesign that a bit.
	* broke the mswordview.c file down a bit into other files. 
changes up to 0.1.0
	* hell ive enough done to warrent a new numbering system.
	so from now on
	x.y.z
	x is a stable bug free (hah) release. folk packaging for commercial
	unices probably should wait for these releases (none yet, i know)
	y is a new feature or enough bugs fixed that you better use this
	version if you want to keep up with the jones. 
	z is some small bug or change that is small enough that i wont upload
	it to sunsite et al automatically, itll be mostly for me.
	* added a defaultfont size option, so that if you think the output is
	too big or small, you can skrink or enlarge it.
	* added a horizontal padding option, you have the option of 3 different
	ways to handle a run of multiple line breaks, though the default is probably 
	the best.
	* tweaked char formatting system, TO-DO overhaul all of that, theres quite
	a few dependancies between the tags thats becoming a little to difficult
	to do by hand, a little stack is called for methinks.
	* added some support for a type of holdover list format found in docs
	converted to word8 from older versions. works on the one i have so far
	though theres more testing to be done with it. missing bullets and 
	incorrect numbering may be related to this. pass them on to me.
	* battered LFO's into submission, this time they'll stay down (i hope).
	found a 4 byte field that i cant figure out where it came from. *shrug*
	wouldnt be the first time that happened though.
	* changed footer and header handling, i now take notice if the first pages
	headers and footers are different that all the others. i still dont get
	section breaks, which i think impact on this, i dont have any examples of
	this to work against. Theres a discrepency between header/footer documentation
	and what i see before me in the hex, maybe im missing something.
	* ok theres some difficulty with tables, ive implemented this baby as a
	one pass parser, later ill have to add multipass (or backpatch) to figure out 
	the number of pages so as to get that field right, but with ms tables you can 
	start off with 2 cols then go to e.g 4 in the same table, you dont know in 
	advance how many rows and cols there are in maxiumum, or which ones span which,
	which is a pain in the butt, really as far as word is concerned each row 
	is a table into itself, so ive done it this way

	- each table has the cols of the first row counted and the widths
	  figured out in % of the page width, if a subsequent row has a different
	  number of rows or different widths than the previous row a new table 
	  will be begun. the % width will cause netscape to line them up correctly.
	  itll do for now. not perfect i know but hey what is. Itll do the job
	  for the primary task which is making word readable as close to the 
	  original layout as possible within html. 
	- to get the tap that tells me all the above we have to scan forward
	  until we find a rowend char, and get the pap of that to get the tap.
	  and with fastsaved theres the usual complexity
	- The problem will be that netscape and other browsers dont take the 
	  width% as their primary factor in determing the actual width of a cell, 
	  if the text in it cannot be broken on a space then the cell is expanded 
	  to fit, breaking the lineing up. Im considering a somewhat more sophisticated
	  (and questionable) technique where i stick the tables together using
	  dithering of the cells to a (max 64 cell (msdefined)) cell grid. using colspan
	  and so on to do it.
	* TO-DO theres something called a header text box that i have to figure out
	  and some companion of it for the main doc. i have to implement something to
	  handle these beasts.
	* TO-DO more testing for bugs and stuff.
	* TO-DO code overhaul to simplify it.
	* TO-DO support all fields, ive some supporte page no, date and time.
	but not perfectly in the same format that word has them in.
	* TO-DO,figure out how to extract ole embedded msoffice draw and equation
	editors data, and see if i can get them converted as well.
	* TO-DO provide alternative outputs, tex/rtf and friends. ive a load of
	formatting information that i think i can get into those formats.
	* TO-DO provide basic formatting for html, i.e centering.
	* TO-DO think about writing word docs :-), now that would be a hunk of work.
	so to all you asking me about it i recommend you dont even bother with it,
	just write rtf files and get on with it, thats even what ms did for word 8,
	saving as word 6/95 just creates a rtf file, if its good enough for them, its 
	good enough for us.
	* TO-THINK-ABOUT i dont keep very much information in memory really, i just work
	out what i need for any given instant and drag it out of the file, and then dump it
	often to only get it again in a few seconds. this leads to an impressive amounting
	of seeking back and forth across the streams. theres a groove burnt in my hd where
	im working, its not really optimum behaviour, (works though :-) )
	* NEED_HELP-ON, can this compile and work under sgi ?, have success reports
	from linux, solaris,hpux,aix,freebsd and one failure to compile under sgi, ive
	one message that it compiles under os/2, though it needs some work to do that.
changes up to 0.0.27
	* know how to do the right thing with embedded sprm list
	gets rid of a few wild bugs.
	* found the list documentation after all, maybe i forgot
	to download it the last time (doh!), or it wasnt there
	when i downloaded it. so i removed all of my rather good
	but unnecessary hex determined code.
	* added a special case for "*" in lists, make it a bullet
	point instead, seems to be the right thing to do (?)
	* changed laola commands name to append -mswordview to avoid
	overwriting newer lls commands etc.
	* changed the INC in perl files to reflect final install dir.
	* TO-WORRY-ABOUT, quite a few ??'s displayed in netscape when
	dealing with those utf-8 docs, dont know if thats my lack of
	correct fonts, or a great big dirty bug. also ive a few special
	cases in the decode_letter to translate letters into what *i* think
	they should be, its rather questionable and very emperically based.
	* added some hook code to protect lists from pagebreaks. 
	in doing so i notice that my complex code is a wee bit confused, but
	it works, so im leaving it alone for now, the added code doesnt make
	for reability but hey, neither does any of the rest of the code :-)
	* fiddled list interpertation so that ilfo isnt looked at until the
	last pap and chp sprms have changed it. fixes difficulties in fast
	saved files.
	* TO-DO
	(list stuff) LFO override not implemented correctly may cause crashes.
	this is surely the last major list related thing to do.
	restarts are probably incorrect as are a few other minor list 
	related bits and pieces
changes up to 0.0.26
	* changed laola lib to a subdir of mswordview and changed laola
	program names to custom mswordview ones, to avoid clashing
	with newer versions or original version of laola, as ive
	doctored things slightly for my own needs.
	* applied Martin Schultze patch to add lib path to perl include
	path, though i twiddled it to make a nice tree in my lib.
	* lists start on the correct number (well ones that are simple
	numerals do anyway).
	* understand list continuing and restarting now.
	* added a defensive patch from Peter Silva <Peter.Silva@ec.gc.ca>
	* lists now get the char formatting that they should get.
	* yes!, sorted lists out, have bulleted lists, arabic & roman numerals,
	lowercase and uppercase lettering systems done. multilevel also works
	i believe, works on all examples i have anyway
	* fixed bug that made mswordview fail on files without an extension
	* TO-DO look at list indentation, if they are true multilevel then
	i blockquote them (for now), but if they have a set indentation value
	then like all the other layout constructs i dont preserve this into 
	html.
	* TO-DO fields, table of contents should be easier with lists
	done.
	* TO-DO find out if my unicode (utf-8) support actually works
	for anyone except me. What fonts do various people need, this
	is a general netscape question.
	* middleterm TO-DO, reorganize tags to external data files, to make extensible
	to other formats, i.e raw ascii, an attempt at latex, rtf. 
changes up to 0.0.25
	* changed list handling slightly, removes a bug where
	you get too many list levels inserted
	* i believe that most lists will now be handled correctly as to
	whether they are numbers or not. I have isolated the undocumented
	section and have a handle on the situation so its just a matter
	to comparing theory with practice again.
	* removed bug where header pap gets used in the main document
	following a header
	* finished checking all uploaded files beginning with a, yipee.
	now theres quite a few elements not addressed yet in those files, but 
	i understand whats involved, in short, section support, proper list 
	support, justification support (centering anyway) decoding of the DATE 
	and TIME fields, would you believe that the TIME field can encode the 
	DATE, despite the fact that theres a DATE field whos job this is !, 
	gagh what can you do with people who do this to you. but anyhow the 
	uploaded all convert without crash, all text is in the right place, and
	in the right language ( i think :-) ).  all bold,italic,font sizes,
	underline, manual page breaks, the content of footnotes,footers 
	and headers is all shown, albeit not always the way they appear in 
	word, yeah we're getting there.
	* changed utf conversion code as the original code i was using wasnt
	quite gpl compatable, anyhow new code is better designed for my needs.
	* TO-DO, grr!! is someone reading this log, as after my weeks holidays
	i note thats theres a huge amout of files beginning with a to go through
	again, i never did make it to b.
changes up to 0.0.24
	* fixed NULL complex pap bug.
	* supports underline tag now as well :-)
	* footnotes supported, all the ones referenced before a 
    pagebreak get listed at the manual pagebreaks and document
	end . (thats a <hr> in my current output, splitting word docs
	into different files is a challenge id rather not accept for 
	now as itd just be guesswork and mess), not checked in fastsave
	yet though.
	* TO-DO support sections, so as to know what pages get headers
	and which dont, etc.
	* TO-DO proper table of contents, the text is now listed
	but theres no link between the table of contents and the
	text it purports to describe, for the moment.
	* TO-DO differenciate between different types of underline
	i.e word for word etc
	* EVENTUALLY-TO-DO, i have come across one case where a symbol 
	used in a footnote isnt working !, if i create one of my own
	it works fine, but when i alter the given one it still 
	occurs, strange.
changes up to 0.0.23
	* verified it works on linux, aix and solaris.
	* fixed a very silly overflow byte vs int bug. 
	* overhauled unicode conversion, fixed my sprm
	size detection.
	* changed table handling so that tables dont
	end prematurely.
	* fixed img insertion dummying of wingding font 
	support.
	* massively changed my paragraph end detection for
	complex files, i had the idea all wrong, but close
	enough that it worked on fairly uniformly formatted
	files.
	* works with all uploaded files beginning with A and a
	theres soooo many to go through :-), im looking
	forward to getting to b soon.
	* TO-DO, continue checking against uploaded files,
	verify header and footer support, start on list
	information (dum de dum dum dummmm)
changes up to 0.0.22
	* check for errno
	* fix list related crash bug, found by Wayne Roberts 
	<milcom@netcom.com>
	* TO-DO, go through the 50 megs of uploaded word
	files and see do the convert fairly correctly :-)
	lists need to be done better. i need to confirm
	language conversion. and check out table of
	contents field.
changes up to 0.0.21
	* for simple format i now decode to utf-8, when appropiate.
	on viewing many docs with windows netscape 4 it works
	fine, i dont have the X fonts to do half of the
	languages under my own X, but hopefully those
	in the various language blocks can figure out
	fonts for themselves ?
	* complex format non-west-european docs might
	still be shagged, id love to hear from an asian
	language group as to whether or not the utf8 works
	for them
	* some bug fixes by Pavel Machek <pavel@Elf.ucw.cz>
changes up to 0.0.20
	* headers are fairly correct now, the spec and me 
	are confused as to headers and footers though, so 
	while i *can* do headers and footers, it might require
	a bit of fine tuning, so i need docs with all sorts
	of header and footer types in them until im sure im right
	, but its close enough.
	* docs with subdocs in them should return the output of
	the main doc now.
	*to do, from the veritable deluge of documents in languages
	i cant read :-), id better handle the non-standard, well
	non standard to me anyway ! russian and one or two
	others that i hope fall out in the process, asian
	would be wonderful.
changes up to 0.0.19
	* header support added to complex format
	* wingding font hack added like symbol font
	* headers are still not right, footers and headers are all 
	appearing at the top of the document, ive more work to do on
	that next.
	* ive shagged up the parsing of lls output, so docs with
	ole inside ole will not work even though theres no good reason
	they dont, bear with me on this
	* mswordview.wrapper added to allow inline viewing of word docs.
changes up to 0.0.18
	* new option to not change msword headings to html headings to 
	support those dodgy people who dont use them correctly.
	* fixed what looks like a specialized case for recognizing tables
	* fixed the lack of - sign.
	* have a new group of files that convert correctly.
	* these are minor changes, ill add header handling to complex
	format tomorrow
changes up to 0.0.17
	* lack of getopt.h on some systems taken into account now.
	* sub and super scripting now in for simple format.
	* laola.pl changed to continue even if it thinks the file is
	the wrong length.
	* added option to not attempt to dummy up formatting done with
	whitespace.
	* using gifs for symbols, this will do for html output, for
	other output in the future we'll have to organize something a 
	little more sohpisticated
	* i have some alpha support for headers in at the moment, 
	if you have headers you "might" see them in russet text.
