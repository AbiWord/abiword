/*! \page af_overview Application Framework

The 'af' directory contains all source code for the cross-platform 
application framework.  This directory contains the following 
subdirectories:

<dl>
<dt>Directory <tt>ev</tt>

  <dd>Source code for the event mechanism for the cross-platform application
      framework. This code contains the machinery to do key bindings,
      mouse bindings, menu bars, and tool bars.  This code is
      currently used by the word processor, but we expect to also use
      it for the spreadsheet application.</dd>

<dt>Directory <tt>gr</tt>
  <dd>Source code for graphics (drawing code, font code, etc.)</dd>

<dt>Directory <tt>util</tt>
  <dd>Source code for general-purpose utility functions.</dd>

<dt>Directory <tt>xap</tt>
  <dd>Source code for application-neutral portion of the
      cross-platform framework defined in <tt>ev</tt>.</dd>

</dl>

<b>FIXME: Need more overviews in sub directories...</b>
