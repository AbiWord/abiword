/* An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
   rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
   interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
   bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
   then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
   that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
   information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
   calling the setstate() function with the same array as was initialized
   with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
   information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
   congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
   32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.  Internally, the
   state information is treated as an array of longs; the zeroth element of
   the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small integer); the remainder
   of the array is the state information for the R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of
   state information will give 7 longs worth of state information, which will
   allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note: The zeroth word of state
   information also has some other information stored in it; see setstate
   for details).  The random number generation technique is a linear feedback
   shift register approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms
   to sum up that way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all
   the numbers in the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register,
   and will have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial
   being used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).
   The higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are
   also influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The
   total period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus
   doubling the amount of state information has a vast influence on the
   period of the generator.  Note: The deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation
   only good for large deg, when the period of the shift register is the
   dominant factor.  With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much
   longer than the 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.  */


/* For each of the currently supported random number generators, we have a
   break value on the amount of state information (you need at least this many
   bytes of state info to support this random number generator), a degree for
   the polynomial (actually a trinomial) that the R.N.G. is based on, and
   separation between the two lower order coefficients of the trinomial.  */
