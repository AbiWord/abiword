	This is not a real dialog.  It is not linked into the application.

	any of these files exist is to make sure that each of the 
	platform-specific stubs will always compile.  

	That way, when those stub files are cloned and renamed to make 
	stubs for other (real) dialogs, we know that they'll compile and 
	not break the build.  
	
	If you're creating a new XP dialog, ignore this file.  You'll be 
	*much* better off stealing code from another existing dialog which 
	does something real.
