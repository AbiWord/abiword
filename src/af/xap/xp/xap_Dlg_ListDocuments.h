/*!

    This dialogue lists documents that are open; by default
    the current document is excluded from the list. This can be
    changed by calling setIncludeActiveDocument(true) before the
    dialogue is displayed.

    PLATFORM NOTES
	--------------
    Platform subclasses need to provide the usual static_constructor()
    and runModal() methods.

    The dialogue contains a single column list which is filled by
    document names using _getDocumentCount() and
    _getNthDocumentName(). There is a heading text for the list,
    obtained through _getHeading();

	When the user selects a particular entry on the list,
	_setSelDocumentIndx() should be called to store the index of the
	selection (if the subclass sorts the list, it needs to ensure that
	the index stored is the original index of that entry).
	
    There should be two buttons: OK and Cancel; the text for the OK
    button needs to be obtained using _getOKButtonText().

	Title for the dialogue window is obtained through _getTitle().

	(this dialogue is very much like ListRevisions, except the list
	has only one column and the OK button label is not static)
