/* EXPLANATION OF THE OVERSTRIKING (or COMBINING) CHARACTERS MECHANISM
   (Tomas, Jan 26, 2003)
   
   We classify overstriking characters into three categories:
   
   1. Characters to be flushed with the near edge of the previous base
      character, or, from the LTR point of view, right-flushed
   2. Characters to be flushed with the far edge of the previous base
      character, or, from the LTR point of view, left-flushed
   3. Characters to be centered over the previous base character

   Whether a Unicode character is overstriking, and if so of what
   type, can be detemined by using the UT_isOverstrikingChar()
   function. The width of the overstriking characters should be reported
   as follows:
   
      Type 1 (right-flushed): width should be set to 0

      Type 2 (left-flushed):  the width of the glyph should be or'ed
                              with GR_OC_LEFT_FLUSHED (defined in gr_Graphics.h)

      Type 3 (centered):      the with of the glyph should be reported
                              as a negative number
