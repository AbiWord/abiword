This tree contains the following top-level subdirectories:

src
	All source code is under here, including applications,
	library modules, and third-party source code.

ac-helpers
	Autoconf macros used by the autoconfiscated build system (configure).

docs
	Documents related to the project.  Includes specifications,
	design documents, and the like.  You should also find instructions
	for how to build the tree in here, within the "build" subdirectory.

po
	Localized strings for each locale we support, in PO format, as well
	as scripts for conversion to and from Abi's native .strings files,
	which are the files actually used directly by the program(s).  PO
	files are maintained as a convenience for translators, many of whom
	are already accustomed to working with them (as opposed to .strings).

regtest
	Regression testing tools (scripts, documents, and the like) reside
	here.

test
	Test files for AbiWord (not explicitly part of regression testing). 

user
	Support files, other than code, which need to be installed
	on the user's machine, are stored in here.  Items which
	are too large to be practical do not necessarily go here,
	such as the fonts.
