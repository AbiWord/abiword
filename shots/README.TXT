The 'shots' directory contains screen shots for all modules and applications
in the tree.  This directory contains the following subdirectories:


xap
	Screen shots for application-neutral cross-platform framework.

wp
	Screen shots for the word processor application.


Having these screen shots in CVS is very useful, but only if we collectively 
make sure to keep them up to date on each platform.  This means that, once 
a dialog is considered to be "done", the corresponding PNG should get checked 
into the appropriate shots subdirectory.  

From that point on, *any* checkin which changes the look of a dialog needs 
to be accompanied by a matching checkin here.
