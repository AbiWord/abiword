 */

/* The default image editor and exported image type depends
 * on the platform.
 *
 * For Windows:
 *   The PNG images by default are converted to BMP files
 *   and the default image editor is Microsoft's (R) Paint (MSPAINT.EXE)
 *     PNG to BMP conversion done using:
 *       PNGDIB - a mini DIB-PNG conversion library for Win32
 *       By Jason Summers  <jason1@pobox.com>
 *
 * For Unix Systems (and similar)
 *   The images are exported as PNG files
 *   and the default image editor is the GIMP (gimp)
 *   GNU Image Manipulation Program - see http://www.gimp.org/
