/**
 * Builds up the TOC body, as OpenOffice.org requires the <text:index-body> tag to 
 * be present and filled when initially opening the document. Without it, it will show 
 * an empty TOC until the user regenerates it, which is not that pretty.
 *
 * Unfortunately, we can't generate an 100% accurate preview. We can't for example
 * output page numbers, as they only exist in AbiWord's layout classes and not in its 
 * PieceTable. Exporting the header outline is the best we can do as long as we don't
 * store all generated TOC data in the PieceTable.
