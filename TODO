Rob's GSoC TODO
===============

Last sync'd with trunk: r23988.

Currently working on / next task: Hook up cairo image class.

1st Part
--------

+ Use cairo for screen graphics in the gtk version [ongoing].
	- Caret is causing screen dirt, investigate GR_CairoGraphics::saveRectangle()
	- Screen dirt/redraw problems when selecting/unselecting text.
	- Tab widget doesn't show up in print view.
	- Scrolling causes content to vanish.
	- Hook up the cairo image class.
	- [DONE] Use only cairo drawing in the screen graphics class.

+ Win32 build of abiword/gtk [ongoing].
	- Implement crash handler properly.
	- [DONE] Portable implementation of command line --geometry parsing.

+ Decouple screen- and print-graphics [ongoing].
	- Fix weird inheritance issue, tagged with "// Why i ihave to upcast manually here is beyond me -Rob."
	- [DONE] s,GR_Graphics,GR_ScreenGraphics where appropriate. Get rid of the recently introduced dynamic casts.


2nd Part
--------

+ Implement/refactor cairo print graphics class.
+ Hook up with GtkPrint infrastructure.


Other
-----

+ GOffice removal.
	- src/af/xap/gtk/xap_UnixDialogHelper.cpp
	  Doesn't gtk set the button order correctly by itself?

+ Rename UnixNull_Graphics to GR_UnixNullGraphics
+ Can we prune all the GraphicsFactory infrastructure?
+ Support SVG as a native image format.
+ Move the cairo screen graphics to XP land, get rid of XAP_DONTUSE_XOR.
+ Move the cairo print graphics to XP land.


Notes for cross platform cairo
------------------------------

+ Use pango or not?
+ Merge GR_Graphics and GR_CairoGraphics.
